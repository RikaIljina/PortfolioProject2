## UX

### Target audience

The target audience for the game are English-speaking teenagers and adults who enjoy trivia games and want to play against a local human opponent.

#### First-time visitors

First-time visitors are greeted by a welcome screen which contains a short game description - a "How-to-play" - as well as two clearly marked input fields for the player names.

#### Returning visitors

Returning visitors can immediately enter their names on page load without having to re-read the game description.

### Site goal

The site goal is to engage two people in a fun quiz game for an unspecified amount of time and encourage them to come back for even more questions to ruminate on and more new facts to learn.
