## UX

### Target audience

The target audience for the game are English-speaking teenagers and adults who enjoy trivia games and want to play against a local human opponent.

#### First-time visitors

First-time visitors are greeted by a welcome screen which contains a short game description - a "How-to-play" - as well as two clearly marked input fields for the player names.

#### Returning visitors

Returning visitors can immediately enter their names on page load without having to re-read the game description.

### Site goal

The site goal is to engage two people in a fun quiz game for an unspecified amount of time and encourage them to come back for even more questions to ruminate on and more new facts to learn.

## Design

When choosing a design for my game, I prioritized clearness and readability to make sure all important information was visible and easily readable to the players at all times and on different screen sizes. At the same time, I chose to implement different colors to give the game a fun and colorful feeling.
The header with the game title and the footer with copyright info are designed to be unobtrusive as to not draw attention away from the main game area.
Since it is a two-player game, each player has their own color that is used in that player's area
